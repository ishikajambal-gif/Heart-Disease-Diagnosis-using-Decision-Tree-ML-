🫀 Heart Disease Diagnosis using Decision Tree (Machine Learning)

Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interpretable Machine Learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data. A Decision Tree Classifier is used to provide transparent, rule-based predictions that are easy to understand in a healthcare context.
The model analyzes multiple medical attributes such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol level, blood pressure, ECG results, and more to determine whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

🎯 Objectives
Predict heart disease presence with high accuracy
Build an interpretable ML model suitable for medical diagnosis
Provide clear evaluation metrics and visual insights
Allow real-time user input for prediction
